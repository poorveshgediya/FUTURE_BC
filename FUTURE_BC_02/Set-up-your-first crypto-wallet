## **Steps to Create a MetaMask Wallet**

1. Download MetaMask
- **Official Website**: Visit [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/).
- **Browser Extension**: Install the MetaMask extension for Chrome, Firefox, or Brave.
- **Mobile App**: Alternatively, download the MetaMask app from the Google Play Store (Android) or Apple App Store (iOS).

2. Set Up Your Wallet
- Open the MetaMask extension or app.
- Click **"Get Started"**.
- Choose **"Create a Wallet"** (if you don't already have an account).

3. Secure Your Recovery Phrase
- MetaMask generates a **12-word Secret Recovery Phrase** during setup.
- **Important**:
  - Write the recovery phrase down on paper or store it in a password manager.
  - Do not share it with anyone.
  - Keep it in a secure location, as this is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access.

4. Create a Password
- Set a strong password for accessing your wallet on the device.
- The password is local to your device, while the recovery phrase secures your account globally.

5. Confirm Recovery Phrase
- Verify the recovery phrase by selecting the words in the correct order.
- This step ensures that you have securely backed up the phrase.

6. Wallet Creation Complete
- Once verified, your wallet is ready to use.
- MetaMask will show the default Ethereum account with a wallet address (e.g., `0x1234...abcd`).
